# Compressors Predictive Maintenance

In this notebook, the predictive maintenance problem is applied to air compressors.

## Repository Structure

functions: created python files
img: pictures
models: machine learning models created for solving the problem
notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks files
streamlit: file to execute the streamlit app


## Conclusions
By analysing the working variables of air compressor, and tracking vibrations, pressure, temperature and currents, is possible to predict whether a compressor will fail in the following X days ("Diagnostics") and determine the Remaining Useful Life ("Prognostics")
